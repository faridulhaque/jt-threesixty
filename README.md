## App Details
### JOb task from M360ICT

* The app has four routes: 1) Home, 2) Search 3) Filter 4) Item Details
* The home page contains the first 20 items. There is a 'see more items' button below, every time you click on it, there will be added 20 more items. 
* By clicking on "See More" from each item, You will be redirected to the details page of that specific item. 
* In the Search Page, primarily you will see all data but when you start typing in the search box, your required items will appear. 
* On the Filter page, you can filter data by upcoming, Status (success, failure), or by time. (last week, last month, or last year). Unfortunately, there are no data from the last year, last month, or last week in this API, so, practically you won't see any data right now by filtering with time. But I created and implemented logic and checked with fake data. The logic is completely fine. 

### Tools
